# spaceship-game

A super simple Space Invaders clone. [Play it here](https://nameless-headland-67770.herokuapp.com/spaceship-game/)

Touch and hold the left or right side of the screen, depending on which way you want to go. Your ship will fire continuously. Hit the targets, but try not to get hit in doing so!

(Designed more for mobile devices than a laptop. If you're playing on a laptop, click and hold on whichever half of the screen you want to move towards.)
